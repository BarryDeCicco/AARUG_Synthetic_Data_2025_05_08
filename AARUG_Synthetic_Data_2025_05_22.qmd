## What is Synthetic Data?

Synthetic data is data created based on a source data set, with individual values changed, but with the same univariate distributions and multivariate relationship.

## Why Use Synthetic Data?

-   A common reason is to allow others to explore and analyze a data sets without compromising participant privacy by releasing identifying information.

-   Another reason would be to allow multiple analyses to be conducted on similar data sets, for learning or testing methods and models.

## Crude Methods

-    

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```
